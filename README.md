Use the menu items to get these apps and shortcuts before continuing.

## Installing a New Mac App Deck

1. Tap New Mac App Deckâ€¦
2. Select the Mac application you want to create a control deck for.
3. Enter the name of your deck. If the deck already exists, you will be prompted to enter a new name or replace the existing deck.
4. The selected deck will then be created in MFC Deck.
5. Choose to open the deck or return to the main menu.

## MFC Deck Key Command

Using the cards in a Mac App Deck requires the use of the [MFC Deck Key Command shortcut](https://mfcdeck.com/key-command).

It is recommended that you create a copy of MFC Deck Key Command for each computer you wish to control. You must enter the following information into Authentication dictionary at the beginning of the shortcut:

- **host**: The hostname for the macOS computer you wish to control. You can get the hostname from System Preferences > Sharing
- **username**: The username for the account you wish to control.
- **password**: The password for the selected user.

**NOTE: Your username and password are stored in the clear within the shortcut. Be sure you DO NOT share this shortcut with anyone, or else they could gain access to your computer.**

## Usage

1. Open MFC Deck.
2. Go to the Mac app deck you created earlier.
3. Tap on the card corresponding to the app action you wish to perform on your macOS computer.

## Troubleshooting

If you are running macOS Catalina or higher, you may have to enable several security preferences in order for your commands to be processed properly. Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy and perform the following actions:

**System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility**

- Terminal should be in the list of apps that can control your computer
- System Events should be in the list of apps that can control your computer

Terminal is used to send the osascript shell script command, which runs the AppleScript used by the System Events to dispatch commands to the correct application.

**System Preferences > Sharing**

- Remote Login must be enabled

- **Icon**: The card's icon. Use sfsymbols or shortcut icons names.

### Shortcut Dictionary Format
